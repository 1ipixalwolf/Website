    <h2>Considering an automated widget?</h2>
    <p>
        Not everyone who makes or has a website is a programmer. Even if they are, making a website 
        that has solid html, or improving the html of one already made takes time and effort. As 
        increasing legislation is put in place and enforced surrounding digital accessibility for 
        screen readers And other assistive technology users, some organizations and companies are 
        feeling the pressure to make their websites accessible. Some of them are turning to automated 
        widgets that are supposed to make websites accessible to do this. The temptation to use an 
        automated widget is very understandable. However, these widgets can be expensive and do not 
        always work very well. Accessibe for example, is $49.99 a month. It still cannot fix many 
        accessibility issues. An automated tool does not always know how to effectively describe an 
        image or make up for a website that does not have adequate HTML, Instead relying too much on 
        CSS. Automated tools still needs to be checked by humans because they are prone to Lots of 
        mistakes. At that point, you might as well just fix the issues. That would be the cheaper 
        option too.
