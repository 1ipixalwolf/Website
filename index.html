    <h1>Web Surfing by Sound</h1>
    <p>
        Some people need to access the digital world non-visually. Often, this is done using screen 
        readers. A screen reader is a software program that ideally speaks aloud what is displayed 
        visually on the screen. Screen reader users navigate using the keyboard rather than a mouse. 
        Some popular ones include JAWS, NVDA, Voiceover, and TalkBack. So, everything‘s great right? 
        The digital world is totally accessible with this amazing tool. Unfortunately, this is not 
        the case. Screen readers rely on what the underlying code looks like. they don’t care about 
        the beautiful graphic user interface on top. If under the pretty pictures there are not 
        enough labels or semantic elements, or if it’s just an image, the screen reader doesn’t do 
        well. These issues are present to varying extents in pretty much every application and 
        website. This will go into putting these commonly faced problems into what they would look 
        like visually. Hopefully, by the end, this convinces some of the need to code clearly.

    <h2>Labels</h2>
    <h3>Useless Buttons</h3>
    <p>
        Surprise! That button looking thing was actually an image. No. It is not just there to mess
        with you. it is the visual equivalent of an issue that screen readers often encounter: things 
        that are called buttons, but do not do anything when clicked. Screen readers tell the user 
        what type of element they are on based on the tag it is given. How annoying was that Next not 
        button? How many times did you click it? Imagine encountering this issue regularly as screen 
        reader users do. That is only the beginning of the accessibility issues common across the
        web.

    <h3>Button?</h3>
    <p>
        Imagine you are looking through a website or app and one or more buttons just says "button". 
        You are pretty sure they are buttons, though as demonstrated above, wether they actually 
        do anything is uncertain. In this case, pressing them is more risky since you have no idea
        what it will do. Is it the submit button? The world peace button? The self destruct button?
        There is no way to know. If crucial buttons are not labeled, the app or sight is unusable.
        The reason this lack of labels is not noticed by sighted users as much is that the buttons 
        still have understandable graphics, just no hover text. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Short and Sweet</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes, something has a label, but it is not helpful.
        <br>
        Nothing will happen when you click these buttons.
