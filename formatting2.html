    <h2>Unpacking THAT</h2>
    <p>
        The previous page was an amalgamation of several issues screen readers commonly face. Let's 
        go through them one by one. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Formatting!!</h2>
    <p>
        Was that article useful? Did you actually read it? If so, have you considered finding a 
        hobby? Surely there are better ways you could have spent your last hour than deciphering 
        that article. This is how things look with no elements under the hood for the screen reader 
        to differentiate between. Was that block of text realistically usable? Would your teacher or
        boss accept a 5 page report that was not separated into paragraphs? The answer to both is 
        definitely
        NO 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Now here is that article with all of its formatting back. it is a compelling study of the 
        accessibility of online job applications. This source is pear reviewed, though not as
        dense as other studies of its kind. See what a big difference formatting makes?

    <h2>Jumpy Jaws</h2>
    <p>
        The page going back to the top every 10 seconds didn't help with that big block of text 
        either, did it? That automatic page refresh was designed to simulate the issue that screen 
        readers have so often where they lose focus and jump back to the top of the page. Better 
        structure and formatting help at least recover from this. Bet you were wishing for a few 
        headings, or at least some line breaks to split up that big block of text and tell you where 
        you left off. That's how screen reader users feel when navigating a page that keeps losing 
        focus and has too few structural elements like headings for the screen reader to jump to 
        quickly. There is no way to skim read with a screen reader. The closest they can come is 
        using headings to navigate quickly. However, this is not the same thing at all. There is no 
        way to quickly and briefly scan a text. This means that massive blocks of text are especially 
        annoying with screen readers. Doing things such as finding quotes in the middle of blocks of 
        text Which visual readers find easy is an impossibility with screen readers without reading a 
        text a bazillion times.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Pop-Ups and Ads</h2>
    <!--
        Interspersed with text, have various things interfere with ease of reading and navigation
        An image that obscures some text making it difficult to read mimicking the way pop-ups start 
        talking over the screen reader
        An Image that canâ€™t be scrolled past
    -->
    <p>
        And then there's the giant unicorn. It makes the text very hard to read, blocking most of the 
        screen. This is similar to the way that pop-ups start talking over the screen reader, making 
        it difficult to hear what it is saying. They also often block progress through the website as 
        they are sometimes impossible to navigate past with a screen reader. These are issues screen 
        readers commonly face. Most ads are not accessible, often rendering the website unusable. 
        This is true for many articles, but especially in every recipe website on Google, at least 
        the top ones.
